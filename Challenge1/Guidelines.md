Challenge 1: Tag, You’re It!


Setup:


Use Surface-A.  Place an empty 12 oz. can in circle 9.


Skills to Learn:

In this challenge, you'll practice driving your robot forward and backward over a set distance. You’ll also learn to drive in a straight line and ensure your robot starts from the same position every time.


Goal:


Your robot must drive to the can in circle 9, touch it (without knocking it down or moving it outside the number nine circle), and return to the starting area (behind the black starting line).


Guidelines:


The robot must start completely BEHIND the inside edge of the starting line.
The robot may start, finish, and drive off the mat during the run.
To complete the challenge:
The can should not tip over.
Part of the can must remain inside the circle.
Your robot must touch the can.
The robot must return to the starting area.

Extensions:


Move the can to different locations to promote mastery of the msleep()function.
Students must drive backward to touch the can with the rear of the robot.
Students must drive out, touch the can, then turn around and drive forward back to the starting box.
Students must optimize and complete the task in the shortest amount of time.

Extensions with Sensors:


Complete this task using only motor position counter values and loops to drive set distances and turn precise angles.
Write your own functions using motor position counters to drive set distances and make precise angle  turns.
Use the reflectance sensor or  motor position counters to find your way back to the start box.
Make your own driving library using your own functions, using motor position counters.
